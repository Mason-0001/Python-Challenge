# Python-Challenge
For this challenge, I used python to collect data from a csv and produce statistics/results. 
For PyBank, I collected budget data and made a simple statistical analysis that printed the results on a new document.
For PyPoll, I collected the data of the election votes and tabulated the votes per candidate as well as the result to a new document.
